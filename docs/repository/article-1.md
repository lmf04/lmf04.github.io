#项目描述
projectDescription:
- The model detects and counts cells in microscopy images with 95.2% accuracy and locates and classifies lung tumors on CT scans, improving accuracy by 23% compared to traditional methods. 
- Built an image preprocessing pipeline supporting DICOM and NIfTI formats to handle biomedical imaging data across different modalities. 
- Designed and implemented an interactive visualization platform using FastAPI for backend and Vue3 for frontend. 
- The platform integrates preprocessing, model inference, annotation, and automated report generation to streamline clinical and research workflows. 
- Package the platform with Docker for deployment on servers and local workstations, ensuring compatibility across devices. The project is publicly available on GitHub.
