title: Bioinformatics Research on HMTp210-Based Serotyping and Epitope Profiling of Avibacterium Paragallinarum 


projectDescription:
- Led a full-stack genomic and structural bioinformatics analysis of HMTp210, a hemagglutinin protein from Avibacterium paragallinarum (Apg), and pioneered the first sequence-based serotyping model for Apg using 91 strains from NCBI. 
- Constructed a robust serotyping framework integrating phylogenetic tree building (PhyloPhlAn), pan-genome analysis (BPGA + MAFFT), and motif detection (MEME), classifying HMTp210 into 3 major serogroups (A/B/C) and 8 subtypes (A1–C3) based on Region2-specific divergence (≥12%). 
- Applied AlphaFold2 for full-length 3D structure prediction of A/B/C representatives, revealing HMTp210 as a trimeric TAA (trimeric autotransporter adhesin) with well-defined head (β-sheet), stalk (“α-helix–loop–β”) and anchor (β-barrel) domains. 
- Performed B-cell epitope prediction using IEDB and Rankpep, identifying 6 conserved immunodominant epitopes enriched in Region2/3, including a novel “clover-shaped loop” structure with >95% cross-serotype conservation. 
- Identified A-type specific epitope (1634N–1640T) and C2-subtype–unique insertions, enabling development of a motif-based subtyping model and offering theoretical groundwork for subtype-specific recombinant vaccine design.
