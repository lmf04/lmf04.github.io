## <span style="color: #2ea760ff;">Research Description:</span>
• Constructed recombinant plasmid pRSFDuet-COL3A1 by preserving the Gly-X-Y repeats of type III collagen and adding a 4DANYTK glycosylation tag and 6His purification tag, based on multiple sequence alignment of 220 homologs. 

• Engineered a dual-plasmid expression system (pRSFDuet-COL3A1-AaFQ and pET45b-α1,6-GlcT) in E. coli BL21(DE3) to co-express AaFQ glycosyltransferase and produce glycosylated collagen (Glc-Col and Glcn-Col). 

• Assessed protein modification using SDS-PAGE and Western blot, which showed increased molecular weight and solubility in glycosylated forms compared to unmodified collagen. 

• Used AlphaFold3 and PyMOL to model surface accessibility and hydrophilicity of glycosylation sites, showing that the modified residues were located on exposed surface regions. 

• Confirmed structural integrity of glycosylated collagen with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy; the α-helical profile remained intact, supporting improved thermal stability.
