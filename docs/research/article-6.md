• Designed a multivariate factorial experiment across three ecotones—freshwater (R), estuarine mix (C), and nearshore seawater (M)—to simulate real-world environmental gradients. Incorporated temperature shifts (18°C, 4°C), nutrient addition (NaNO₃), microbial inhibition (HgCl₂), and light exposure, with rigorous parallel replicates. 

• Conducted high-frequency sampling across six timepoints over a 60-day incubation period (Day 0–59), tracking TOC, CDOM, FDOM, pH, and salinity. Modeled TOC decay using first-order kinetics to quantify metabolic intensity and temporal response. 

• Identified key patterns: rapid TOC loss in early stages due to microbial activity; temperature-modulated pH shifts via CO₂ solubility and metabolic regulation; initial salinity rise linked to microbial metabolism; and marked TOC spatial heterogeneity across zones (estuary > river by 78.51%). 

• Integrated experimental data to clarify how temperature, microbial activity, and nutrient input jointly regulate carbon and nitrogen turnover pathways, rates, and feedback mechanisms in river–estuary–coastal continua.
